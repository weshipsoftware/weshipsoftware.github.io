<h2 id="why">Why Are We Doing This?</h2>

We left our jobs in the enterprise tech industry after seeing how many
independent businesses could take off with the right software yet
_aren’t doing anything to make it happen_.

Why not? After asking around, their feedback was clear. Freelancers are
unreliable, hiring platforms are saturated, and recruiting agencies are
expensive.

<aside class="right">
	The way development should have been done in the first place.
</aside>

We can do better. Our goal is to **de–risk software development** by working
directly with a small roster of clients to build and ship exactly
what they need on a predictable timeline and at a reasonable price.





<h2 id="fit">Where Do We Fit?</h2>

### Bespoke Development

If all this tech stuff is not the core of your business, hiring full–time
project managers and engineers is too much.

We’ll work with you to turn your ideas into shipping software that will
**amplify your business**. This could be a website that generates better leads,
a mobile app to connect with your customers, a process automation that scales
your service, or even a completely new product that expands your market.

<aside class="left">
	You won’t want to go anywhere else.
</aside>

It’s our job to handle all the small details that make sure your project is
done correctly from start to finish so you can stay focused on running the rest
of your business.

### Hands–On Consulting

If all this tech stuff _is_ your business and you could use an assist,
**tap into our years of industry experience** building and shipping software
used by thousands of businesses and millions of customers all around the world.

This is perfect if you’re starting a new venture, want to overhaul an in–flight
project, or need to scale up faster than you can hire. **We’ll improve
every step of the process**.

<aside class="right">
	We work best with people who are willing to try new approaches.
</aside>

And we’re not just strategy advisors, _we like to roll up our sleeves and do
the hard work_. We have a clear sense of how things should work, we’re eager
to figure out what we don’t yet know, and we’re particularly effective at
short–circuiting bureaucracy and red tape.

### Creative Partnerships

For content creators growing a niche online audience,
merch sales and ad spots are the go–to revenue streams.

Why not step it up and create a stable business?

<aside class="left">
	This is by far the best model we’ve seen to grow a business.
</aside>

Partner with us to build a **productized service tailored to your audience**.
Your connection to your fans almost guarantees a product–market fit.

We build it, you pitch it. _And we’ll cover the development costs in exchange
for splitting the profits._





<h2 id="price">How Much Does It Cost?</h2>

Our rate is a flat <mark>$4k per week</mark>.

<aside class="right">
	Our rates are not based on your budget.
</aside>

No worries about hours, no minimum contract lengths,
and no need to negotiate scope changes when you come
up with a great new idea.

Once the project wraps up and you’re happy with our work,
we can set up ongoing support for a reasonable rate.





<h2 id="contact">We Want to Hear From You!</h2>

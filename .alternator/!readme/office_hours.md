## Office Hours

Each week we set aside a few hours to meet new people.
Not as a service or a sale pitch, just a video call.

  Let’s grab a coffee.

<p><mark>We want to meet you.</mark></p>

The topic can be anything you want &mdash; you don’t even have to tell us ahead
of time.

So far we’ve
given feekback on projects,
shared tiki cocktail recipes,
screened candidates for job openings,
talked hockey,
debugged servers,
reviewed resumes,
and even acted as sales engineers.

Our prices are fixed so you know exactly what you’re paying and
we’ll work with you to define _done_ so you know exactly what you're getting.
**No surprises**.

By keeping our team small and only working with experienced pros we already
know and trust, we’re **more reliable than a freelancer** while also being
**more affordable than an agency**.

We don't do long contracts or hourly invoicing. Instead, **you'll pay us with
each iteration**. That way you're involved in the feedback loop — making
project adjustments as we go **without needing to negotiate scope changes**.

You'll get **better final product** on a **more predicatable timeline**.

## What To Expect

**We don’t track hours.** You don’t want us wasting time and neither do we.
Tasks will take as much time as they take. Billing by the hour conflicts
both our interests. Better we stay aligned.

**We work remote.** Our own workspaces are both more productive and more
economical. Other than the occassional get–together, there’s no reason for us to
be in anyone’s office.

**We don’t oursource.** Experience is our greatest advantage. While we’re happy
to collaborate with other pros we know and trust, we do everything we’re good at
in–house. And the amount of time it takes to manage an outsourced project to our
high standards would defeat the purpose.

**We ship a little at a time.** No matter how large the project, we’ll break it
down into small tasks we can ship frequently.

**We don’t cut corners.** If we do it right we don’t have to do it again later.

**Keep it simple.** The best software serves it’s purpose and nothing more. We
don’t overcomplicate our solutions, we don’t upsell, and we don’t do vendor
lock–ins. We do the simplest thing that works for your business.

**Estimates are guesses.** We give best–effort estimates on how long things will
take, but ultimately we’re guessing based on past experience. The pace of
shipping smaller tasks is the best reflection of how long a project will take.

**Scope changes are fine.** We expect you to be in the loop as projects develop.
If you change your mind on something, or if a better idea comes up, great. That
just means the end result will be even better. We’re fast on our feet anyway.

**No scamware.** We don’t do cyrpto, NFTs, web3, gambling, or basically anything
in a legal or financial gray area.

**No refunds.** Due to the time consuming nature of the work, we cannot offer
any refunds. However, the first 7 days are free so if it's not a good fit,
there’s no cost to cancel early.

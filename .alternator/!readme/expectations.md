## What To Expect

**Focus on value.** Ship the most valuable parts first and add the rest as we
go. Why wait?

**Scope changes are fine.** If it improves the product, let’s do it. No need to
negotiate changes.

**Ship a little at a time.** However large the project, we break it down into
small tasks to ship often.

**Work together.** You know your business better than we do. Help us find the
best solutions.

**No outsourcing.** We collaborate with other pros we trust but we never hand
our own work off to anyone.

**Overcommunicate.** We maintain expectations to avoid surprises.

**Estimates are guesses.** Working software is the measurement of progress.
Plan, then ship often.

**Do it right.** We do it right the first time so we don’t have to do it again
later. No cutting corners.

**Keep it simple.** No overcomplicated solutions, no upselling, and no vendor
lock–ins.

**Work remote.** Software is built online, not in an office. Also, watching us
type is boring.

**We don’t do scamware.** No cyrpto, NFTs, web3, or anything else designed to
prey on people.

**No refunds.** The first 7 days are free so if it's not a good fit,
there’s no cost to cancel.

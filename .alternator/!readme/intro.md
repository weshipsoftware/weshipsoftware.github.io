**We Ship Software** is a new service by [Jarrod Taylor][rjt] and
[Richard Rissanen][rar] focused on one thing: **shipping software**.

<!-- TODO: Add testimonials. -->

We’ve been lucky to work with some very talented people over the years at all
kinds of agencies, startups, local shops, and big tech companies. 

And we’ve built some great digital products and services used by
**thousands of businesses and millions of customers**
all over the world every day.

But there's one problem we’ve yet to see solved…

<p>
  <mark>Finding people who know what they’re doing is</mark>
<br />
  <mark>much harder than it should be.</mark>
</p>

Agencies are expensive. Freelancers are unreliable.
Estimates are all over the place. Hiring takes forever.
And you never what you’re going to get.
<!-- A few more of these. -->

_The whole process is broken._

So let's do something better. Let's do this right.

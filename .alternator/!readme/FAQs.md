## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>How will I make requests?</summary>
  <p>
    We use Basecamp to manage projects. You'll receive an invite to a Basecamp
    project where you can add requests, check on progress, and collaborate
    on any supporting materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you'd like to use a different management tool, just let us know.

    that can be shipped every few days.

  <summary>What about project planning/estimates?</summary>
  <p>
    We'll work with you on project planning to break everything down into
    easily shippable requests.

    You'll be able to make a reasonably accurate estimate on time-to-completion
    based on how many requests are remaining and the pace of shipping.

<details>
  <summary>What about scope changes?</summary>
  <p>
    By shipping piece by piece and keeping you in the loop as we go, we expect feedback.
    Making feedback based changes along the way is part of the process.

  <summary>What technologies do you work with?</summary>
  <p>
    We're not picky. If it runs on a MacBook, we can work with it.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary>Do you outsource work?</summary>
  <p>
    For our primary work, no. We've been shipping software for many years now
    and we take pride it doing it right.
  </p>
  <p>
    Occasionally something comes up that's too far outside our comfort zone
    so we'll bring in someone we trust to help. We'll always discuss this
    with you ahead of time.

<details>
  <summary>How does the pausing work?</summary>
  <p>
    You can pause your subscription at any time and the remaining days will be
    available to anytime in the future.
  </p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Are there any refunds?</summary>
  <p>
    Due to the time consuming nature of the work, we cannot offer any refunds.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the first 7 days are free so if it's not a good fit there's no
    cost to cancel early.

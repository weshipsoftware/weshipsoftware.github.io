## Services

By keeping our team small, only working with experienced pros,
we're **more reliable than a freelancer** and **more affordable than an agency**.

Our prices are fixed so you know exactly what you're paying and
we'll work with you to define "done" so you know exactly what you're getting.
**No surprises**.

Clear writing is clear thinking, so we like to **overcommunicate** via email and chat.

We prefer to work with startups or small-to-medium sized businesses
who we can really get to know and grow with,
though occassionally we do work with small teams inside bigger companies.

  <dt>Agile Project</dt>

    <p>Turn that million dollar idea in your notebook into shipping software.</p>

      We'll work with you to come up with a project plan and give you our best-effort
      timeline estimates.

      We like to work in 1 to 3 week iterations, delivering small, working pieces
      of software at each step until the project is complete and you're
      ready to onboard customers.

      We don't do long contracts. Instead, you'll pay us with each iteration.
      That way you're involved in the feedback loop &mdash; making product adjustments
      as we go without needing to negotiate scope changes. It'll lead to a better
      final product on a more predicatable timeline.

  <strong>We Ship Software</strong> is a new service by
  <a href="http://jarrodtaylor.me/readme">Jarrod Taylor</a> and
  <a href="https://richard.is">Richard Rissanen</a> focused on one thing:
  <strong>shipping software</strong>.
</p>
<!-- TODO: Add testimonials. -->
<p>
  We‚Äôve been lucky to work with some very talented people over the years at all
  kinds of agencies, startups, local shops, and big tech companies.
</p>
<p>
  And we‚Äôve built some great digital products and services used by
  <strong>thousands of businesses and millions of customers</strong> all over
  the world every day.
</p>
<p>But there‚Äôs one problem we‚Äôve yet to see solved‚Ä¶</p>
<p>
  <mark>Finding people who know what they‚Äôre doing is</mark>
  <br />
  <mark>much harder than it should be.</mark>
</p>
<p>
  Agencies are expensive. Freelancers are unreliable. Estimates are all over the
  place. Hiring takes forever. And you never what you‚Äôre going to get.
</p>
<!-- A few more of these. -->
<p><em>The whole process is broken.</em></p>
<p>So let‚Äôs do something better. Let‚Äôs do this right.</p>

  <strong>more predicatable timeline</strong>.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<details open>
  <summary>How will I make requests?</summary>
  <p>
    We use Basecamp to manage projects. You'll receive an invite to a Basecamp
    project where you can add requests, check on progress, and collaborate on
    any supporting materials.
  </p>
  <p>If you'd like to use a different management tool, just let us know.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How many requests can I make?</summary>
  <p>
    You can add as many requests as you'd like. We'll keep working until they're
    all complete.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How long do requests usually take to complete?</summary>
  <p>
    We aim to ship requests every few days. If a request is going to take
    longer, we'll keep you in the loop.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How do you handle large requests?</summary>
  <p>
    We break down larger requests (and even entire projects) in smaller requests
    that can be shipped every few days.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What about project planning/estimates?</summary>
  <p>
    We'll work with you on project planning to break everything down into easily
    shippable requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll be able to make a reasonably accurate estimate on time-to-completion
    based on how many requests are remaining and the pace of shipping.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What about scope changes?</summary>
  <p>
    By shipping piece by piece and keeping you in the loop as we go, we expect
    feedback. Making feedback based changes along the way is part of the
    process.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What technologies do you work with?</summary>
  <p>We're not picky. If it runs on a MacBook, we can work with it.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Do you outsource work?</summary>
  <p>
    For our primary work, no. We've been shipping software for many years now
    and we take pride it doing it right.
  </p>
  <p>
    Occasionally something comes up that's too far outside our comfort zone so
    we'll bring in someone we trust to help. We'll always discuss this with you
    ahead of time.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Are there any requests you don‚Äôt support?</summary>
  <p>
    We don't do cyrpto, NFTs, web3, gambling, basically anything in a legal or
    financial gray area.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does the pausing work?</summary>
  <p>
    You can pause your subscription at any time and the remaining days will be
    available to anytime in the future.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Are there any refunds?</summary>
  <p>
    Due to the time consuming nature of the work, we cannot offer any refunds.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the first 7 days are free so if it's not a good fit there's no cost
    to cancel early.
  </p>
</details>
<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>
  Each week we set aside a few hours to meet new people. Not as a service or a
  sale pitch, just a video call.
</p>
<aside>
  In the West Palm Beach or Nashville areas?
  <br /><br />
  Let‚Äôs grab a coffee.

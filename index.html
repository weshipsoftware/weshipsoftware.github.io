				<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>
	<mark>We Ship Software</mark> is a small software development agency
	by <a href="https://jarrodtaylor.me/">Jarrod Taylor</a>
	& <a href="https://richard.is/">Richard Rissanen</a>
	focused on one thing: <strong>shipping software</strong>.
</p><p>We’re veterans of the tech industry now working with <strong>independent, product–led businesses</strong> to build and ship awesome software.</p><hr><ul><li><a href="#why">Why Are We Doing This?</a></li><li><a href="#fit">Where Do We Fit?</a></li><li><a href="#price">How Much Does It Cost?</a></li><li><a href="#contact">We Want to Hear From You!</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="why">Why Are We Doing This?</h2><p>How many businesses could take off with better software? Yet freelancers are unreliable, hiring platforms are a mess, and recruiting agencies are too expensive.</p><p>We started <em>We Ship Software</em> to offer something better.</p><p>Our goal is to <strong>de–risk development</strong> by working directly with a small roster of clients to build and ship exactly what they need on a predictable timeline for a reasonable rate.</p><h2 id="fit">Where Do We Fit?</h2><h3>Bespoke Development</h3><p>If all this tech stuff is not the core of your business, hiring full–time project managers and engineers is too much.</p><p>We’ll work with you to turn your ideas into shipping software that will <strong>amplify your business</strong>. This could be a website that generates better leads, a mobile app to connect with your customers, a process automation that scales your service, or even a completely new product that expands your market.</p><aside class="left">
	You won’t want to go anywhere else.
</aside><p>It’s our job to handle all the small details that make sure your project is done correctly from start to finish so you can stay focused on running the rest of your business.</p><h3>Hands–On Consulting</h3><p>If all this tech stuff <em>is</em> your business and you could use an assist, <strong>tap into our years of industry experience</strong> building and shipping software used by thousands of businesses and millions of customers all around the world.</p><p>This is perfect if you’re starting a new venture, want to overhaul an in–flight project, or need to scale up faster than you can hire. <strong>We’ll improve every step of the process</strong>.</p><aside class="right">
	We work best with people who are willing to try new approaches.
</aside><p>And we’re not just strategy advisors, <em>we like to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work</em>. We have a clear sense of how things should work, we’re eager to figure out what we don’t yet know, and we’re particularly effective at short–circuiting bureaucracy and red tape.</p><h3>Creative Partnerships</h3><p>For content creators growing a niche online audience, merch sales and ad spots are the go–to revenue streams.</p><p>Why not step it up and create a stable business?</p><aside class="left">
	This is by far the best model we’ve seen to grow a business.
</aside><p>Partner with us to build a <strong>productized service tailored to your audience</strong>. Your connection to your fans almost guarantees a product–market fit.</p><p>We build it, you pitch it. <em>And we’ll cover the development costs in exchange for splitting the profits.</em></p><h2 id="price">How Much Does It Cost?</h2><p>Our rate is a flat <mark>$4k per week.</mark></p><aside class="right">
	<a href="mailto:email@weshipsoftware.com">Contact us</a> for a
	free scope consultation.
</aside><p>No worries about hours, no minimum contract lengths, and no need to negotiate scope changes when you come up with a great new idea.</p><p>Once the project wraps up and you’re happy with our work, we can set up ongoing support for a reasonable rate.</p><h2 id="contact">We Want to Hear From You!</h2><aside class="left">

        <h1>Now Shipping!</h1>
<p>
  <strong>We Ship Software</strong> is a new service by
  <a href="https://richard.is">Richard Rissanen</a> and
  <a href="http://jarrodtaylor.me/readme">Jarrod Taylor</a> focused on one
  thing: <strong>shipping software</strong>.
</p>
<aside class="right pointing">
  What you'll tell people after working with us.
</aside>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    These guys rock! They really know their stuff. While most agencies are
    focused on upselling, We Ship Software focuses on shipping. They get it
    done.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  We've spent years working in the tech industry, iterating on product
  direction, project management, UX design, engineering, testing, marketing, and
  monetizing.
</p>
<p>
  We’ve been lucky to work with some very talented people over the years at all
  kinds of agencies, startups, local shops, and big tech companies.
</p>
<p>
  And we’ve built some great digital products and services that
  <mark>thousands of businesses and millions of consumers</mark>
  all around the world use every day.
</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>
  By keeping our team small, only working with experienced pros, we're
  <strong>more reliable than a freelancer</strong> and
  <strong>more affordable than an agency</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Our prices are fixed so you know exactly what you're paying and we'll work
  with you to define "done" so you know exactly what you're getting.
  <strong>No surprises</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Clear writing is clear thinking, so we like to
  <strong>overcommunicate</strong> via email and chat.
</p>
<p>
  We prefer to work with startups or small-to-medium sized businesses who we can
  really get to know and grow with, though occassionally we do work with small
  teams inside bigger companies.

      This is perfect if you either want to augment your existing team or have

    <p>
      Common uses are website and mobile app maintenance, copywriting, small
      design efforts, managing projects and teams, prototyping ideas, QA
      assistance, or just adding someone to your team who knows how to get
      things done.

    <p>
      Turn that million dollar idea in your notebook into shipping software.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll work with you to come up with a project plan and give you our
      best-effort timeline estimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we'll work with you on designing, building, testing, and deploying
      your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      We like to work in 1 to 3 week iterations, delivering small, working
      pieces of software at each step until the project is complete and you're
      ready to onboard customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don't do long contracts. Instead, you'll pay us with each iteration.
      That way you're involved in the feedback loop &mdash; making product
      adjustments as we go without needing to negotiate scope changes. It'll
      lead to a better final product on a more predicatable timeline.
    </p>
    <p>Let's build something together.</p>
    <p><strong>$5,995/week</strong></p>

  <dt>Value & Profit Optimization</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      If your business is already up and running, we'll work with you on
      creative ways to reach more people, convert more of them to paying
      customers, and segment your offerings for more profit.

<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>
  Each week we set aside a few hours to meet new people. Not as a service or a
  sale pitch, just a video call.

  In Nashville or West Palm Beach?

  Let's grab a coffee.

<p><mark>We want to meet you.</mark></p>
<p>
  The topic can be anything you want &mdash; you don’t even have to tell us
  ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
  So far we've given feekback on projects, shared tiki cocktail recipes,
  screened candidates for job openings, talked hockey, debugged servers,
  reviewed resumes, and even acted as sales engineers.
